"Implants are not deep, we know abutments will be visible.   Thanks,  ChelseaPlease support the soft tissue in the interproximals, but contour the soft tissue on the buccals and linguals. I would like them to be tooth shaped, not circles, so they will be longer buccal to lingual than they will be mesial to distal.   Keep them 2.5mm from opposer.   Please round all edges on the occlusal tables and give us shoulder margins, not chamfermargins, with the buccal shoulder slightly broader than therest of the shoulder margin.
