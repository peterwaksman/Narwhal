class NarVault:
    """
    The "vault" (NarVault below) is a repository for records of a
    narrative, encountered in the course of reading a text.
    It consists of an array of finalized NarRecords. It also contains
    a preliminary NarRecord called "pre". The "pre" NarRecord is regarded
    as a staging area. This record can still be modified (eg negated) or
    abandoned. At some point, triggered by the client of this code, a 
    "vaulting" event may occur, taking the "pre" and putting into a finalized 
    array where it can no longer be modified.
    
    To "roll up" the vault means to push something new (perhaps a NULL_VAR) 
    into the "pre" staging area, while also pushing what was already in
    the "pre" into the final repository (unless it is NULL_VAR).
    For convenience, the nar record includes the relevant snippet of
    original text. So later the vault can be evaluated by the client.
