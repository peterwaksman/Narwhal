Narwhal is a library of objects that can read text. It uses keywords based on client-provided synonym lists and also client-provided formulas in the keywords. So the client can focus on the details of the topic vocabularies and how people express themselves, rather than on how language works. While relying on Narwhal to understand the incoming language the client must still write code that transfers information from the Narwhal objects into more convenient data structures. 

The Narwhal approach is to embed detailed topic knowledge. This is called "narrow world language processing". Here, the "narrow world" of the client's topics is essentially the same thing as a semantic "frame” as described by Fillmore and archived at Berkeley's FrameNet.
