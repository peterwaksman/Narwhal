bouncy is a chatbot example with a ball moving around the screen as you give it commands:

show/hide {ball, scale} [{ red, green, - } ]

make {ball}{ red, green, big, small } 

move  {ball} { left, right }

zoom  { in , out }

It is easy to handle structured commands with the NWTopicChat ("tchat")
